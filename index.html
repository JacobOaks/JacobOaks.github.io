					<h3>About Me</h2>
					I'm a software enthusiast and a junior undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in computer science and minoring in French and music. I've
					had the pleasure to work on a variety of group and solo projects, some of which are listed below.
					<br />
					<br />
					My biggest passions include: self-driving and electric cars, designing innovative video games and exploring new game areas, developing powerful software, and listening to fantastic music.

					<!-- GeoArt -->
					<h3>GeoArt</h3>
					<div>
						GeoArt is a computational art program that my friend and I made for SteelHacks 2019. It is an iOS app that uses the location of the user
						to create a piece of art entirely unique to that location. We only had 24 hours, so the art wasn't very beautiful, but it was interesting
						to see the differences between places far apart. For example, here is a piece of art generated by a phone whose location was set to rural Brazil:
					</div>
					<br /> <br />
					<img src="images/geoart1.png" style="max-width: 50%"</img>
					<br /> <br />
					<div>
						To contrast, here is a piece of art generated by a phone whose location was set to suburban Japan:
					</div>
					<br /> <br />
					<img src="images/geoart2.png" style="max-width: 50%"</img>
					<br /> <br />
					<div>
						While these two pieces are very different, pieces generated by phones closer to each other would share a lot more similar qualities. This app
						won us 2nd place in the hack-a-thon.

					<!-- Ambulare -->
					<h3>Ambulare</h3>
					<div>
					<div>
						Ambulare is a solo project that I have worked on to teach myself graphics rendering using OpenGL. It is a simple side-scrolling videeo game
						with a custom physics engine, rendering framework, shader programs, and set of graphics - all built upon the light-weight java game library.
						While Ambulare never got to a point where it had a lot of gameplay to offer, I learned a lot about design, user experience, rendering, and
						physics. Here is a video of the game (slightly laggy due to being recorded on a MacBook):

					<!-- Future Work -->
					<h3>Future Work</h2>
					I currently work as an intern at Carngie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute with their Emerging Technologies Center, where I've contributed to
					contemporary machine learning research, built responsive web demonstrations, handled, processed, and analyzed large sets of data, and collaborated with some of
					machine learning's greatest minds.
					<br />
					<br />
					I'm looking for opportunities working with companies that share my passion of developing powerful software centered on user experience and innovation. This includes
					making traditional video games, exploring AR and VR, testing new game genres, creating fintech programs, making utility programs, developing mobile apps, etc.
					<br />
					<br />
					I'm happy to talk about anything with anybody on this portfolio with anybody who is interested. My contact info is listed at the top of the page.
