						I'm a passionate programmer with background in machine learning and game development. I 
						received my BS in computer science from the University of Pittsburgh in 2021, and
						have since been a software developer at Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute.
						<br />
						<br />
						My main interests include working on cool programming projects with awesome teams, playing MMOs, learning to cook, and playing the guitar.
						My primary programming languages are Python and Java.

						<br/>
						<br/>
						Spacedust is an android game with a simple concept: you control a spaceship lost in deep space, and every 
						other spaceship wants to blow you up until you're nothing but spacedust. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						This app was built upon OpenGL ES, a subset of OpenGL meant for mobile and embedded systems. 
						It was a short project, but it taught me how to create a game with mobile in mind, especially how differently 
						controls work from PC. I programmed the joysticks myself, working with simple touch/hold input data from Android. 
						Everything else seen here - textures, rendering pipeline/shaders, basic physics and lighting - is also custom made.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						I'd like to iterate on this project with new prototypes containing more than one level, some sort of ship 
						progression/customizability, more enemy variety, some sounds, some more level design, some particles and 
						explosions, and maybe some more fleshed out story/missions.

					<!-- Ambulare -->
					<h4>Ambulare</h4>
					<div style = "margin: 40px; font-size: max(13px, 2vmin); line-height: max(16px, 3vmin)"> 
						<iframe

						<br/>
						<br/>
						Ambulare is a fun little side-scrolling engine that I built from scratch on top of LWJGL. This demo shows 
						off most of the capabilities, including a custom physics engine, a sound system, lighting systems, animations, 
						and menus. All of the textures and sounds are homemade as well.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						One capability not shown in this demo is the custom readable serialization format I created in order to allow 
						the idea of "stories". A story consists of multiple interconnected levels, such as Dank Cellar and Galen Forest 
						shown in the demo. By understanding the simple serialization format read in by the program, entire stories 
						consisting of custom levels, blocks, textures, backgrounds, foliage, etc. can be created without touching any code at all.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						In an alternate universe where I had unlimited time I would extend this project by adding many more levels, 
						implementing enemies and combat, inventory and equipment systems, game saving/loading, and some sort of journal/quest 
						system - all of which would be fully customizable for any aspiring custom story creator. I would also extend the 
						soundscape to include homemade music and ambient noises.

					<h4>GeoArt</h4>
					<div style = "margin-top: 40px; font-size: max(13px, 2vmin); line-height: max(16px, 3vmin)"> 
						GeoArt is a iOS app that was made for Steelhacks 2019. The project won second place.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The app uses a devices's location to create a unique piece of art. It does this by processing each 
						digit of the devices's longitude and latitude as different parameters. For example, one digit may 
						represent one shape's size, while another may represent the blue component of the piece's background 
						color. The nature of the algorithm ensures that each piece of art is unique to its longitude and 
						latitude. Additionally, since locations that are close together share many of the greater digits of 
						latitude and longitude, the generated pieces of art for locations that are nearby each other - 
						while still unique - should share resemblance proportional to how nearby they are.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Here are two examples of pieces of art from completely separate areas of the world:
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Japan:
						<br/>
						<img src="images/geoart1.png" style="width: min(200px, 40%)"></img>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Brazil:
						<br/>
						<img src="images/geoart2.png" style="width: min(200px, 40%)"></img>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						If this project were done over a timespan longer than a weekend, more time could have been spent on attemping 
						other, more interesting components of an art piece to generate, rather than just simple polygons and colors.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						There are a couple practical applications we had in mind for this app.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						For one, it would be very cool to have one's background set to the artwork corresponding to their current 
						location. Their phone's background would change as the user went about their daily life, and the user would 
						begin to associate places with specific pieces of art. Seeing what piece of art awaits them could be added to 
						list of excitements involved in a user's traveling to a new place.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Some other folks who have seen this project have also noted how it could be used for security purposes or 
						proof of location purposes. Having obtained and saved a specific piece of art could prove to somebody that 
						the user was in a certain location that they were supposed to be in.
